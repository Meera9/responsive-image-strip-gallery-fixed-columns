# 🌿 Responsive Image Strip Gallery (Fixed Columns)

A fully responsive **gallery strip layout** using **CSS Flexbox with fixed columns** and **JavaScript fade-in animation**.  
Perfect for **Squarespace**, **WordPress**, or **custom HTML** sites that need control over fixed column galleries.

## 💡 Idea Behind This Project

I created this project after discovering that **Squarespace’s built-in Strip Gallery layout** does not support a **fixed column gallery** — especially when mixing **portrait and landscape** images.

I had posted and explored multiple discussions, including:
🔗 [Squarespace Forum Thread](https://forum.squarespace.com/topic/339316-strips-layout-gallery-mix-with-potrait-and-landscape-with-6-column-with-6-images-same-alignment/#comment-876114)

After not finding a clear working solution or guidance, I decided to **build and share** this working version of a **fixed-column responsive strip gallery** using **custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Hopefully, this helps other developers and designers who want a clean, professional, and balanced layout for mixed-orientation images.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Fixed number of columns per row (e.g., 5 desktop, 4 tablet, 3 mobile)  
✅ Clean and modern design using CSS Flexbox  
✅ Lightweight — no jQuery or frameworks required  
✅ Loads images one-by-one with fade-in animation  
✅ Works perfectly when embedded in **Squarespace Code Blocks**

## 💡 Why It’s Useful for Squarespace Users

Squarespace does not support **flex gallery with fixed column width** by default.  
With this project, users can easily inject **custom CSS and JS** to build a professional grid-style gallery that aligns perfectly.

## 🧠 How to Use (Squarespace / HTML)

1. Copy HTML from `index.html` → paste into **Code Block**.  
2. Copy CSS from `style.css` → paste into **Design → Custom CSS**.  
3. Add the JS (`gallery.js`) content into **Code Injection → Footer**.  
4. Save and refresh — images appear row by row.
