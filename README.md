# 🌿 Responsive Image Strip Gallery (Fixed Columns)

A fully responsive **gallery strip layout** using **CSS Flexbox with fixed columns** and **JavaScript fade-in animation**.  
Perfect for **Squarespace**, **WordPress**, or **custom HTML** sites that need control over fixed column galleries.

---

## 💡 Idea Behind This Project

I created this project after discovering that **Squarespace’s built-in Strip Gallery layout** does not support a **fixed column gallery** — especially when mixing **portrait and landscape** images.

I had posted and explored multiple discussions, including:
🔗 [Squarespace Forum Thread](https://forum.squarespace.com/topic/339316-strips-layout-gallery-mix-with-potrait-and-landscape-with-6-column-with-6-images-same-alignment/#comment-876114)

After not finding a clear working solution or guidance, I decided to **build and share** this working version of a **fixed-column responsive strip gallery** using **custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Hopefully, this helps other developers and designers who want a clean, professional, and balanced layout for mixed-orientation images.

> 💡 If you’re using Squarespace or any CMS that supports custom code injection,  
> you can copy the HTML + CSS from this repository and enjoy a fully functional gallery with fixed columns.

## 🧩 How It Works

The script dynamically adjusts image widths and heights per row while maintaining proper aspect ratios.  
It ensures all rows align evenly across a fixed number of columns using Flexbox layout principles.

## 💡 Why It’s Useful for Squarespace Users

Squarespace does not support **flex gallery with fixed column width** by default.  
With this project, users can easily inject **custom CSS and JS** to build a professional grid-style gallery that aligns perfectly.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Meera9/responsive-image-strip-gallery-fixed-columns.git

---

## 🧠 How to Use (Squarespace / HTML)

1. Copy HTML from `index.html` → paste into **Code Block**.  
2. Copy CSS from `style.css` → paste into **Design → Custom CSS**.  
3. Add the JS (`gallery.js`) content into **Code Injection → Footer**.  
4. Save and refresh — images appear row by row.
